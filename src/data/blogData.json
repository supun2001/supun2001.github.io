        "content": "<p>Ethical hacking is evolving. In a world where AI is becoming the norm, security professionals must adapt. The tools are getting smarter, but so are the attackers.</p><h3>1. AI-Powered Reconnaissance</h3><p>Traditional scanning is being replaced by intelligent discovery tools that can predict vulnerabilities before they are even exposed.</p><h3>2. Automation in Remediation</h3><p>The gap between detection and patching is closing. Automated systems can now detect and neutralize threats in real-time.</p><p>Conclusion: The mindset of an ethical hacker remains their most valuable tool—curiosity, persistence, and strategic thinking.</p>",

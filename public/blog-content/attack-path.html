<h2>Cloud Privilege Escalation: The “Identity” Attack Path</h2>

<p>
    In 2025, cloud breaches rarely start with a zero-day.
</p>

<p>
    Instead, they start with something much quieter:
    <strong>a misconfigured identity</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    In modern cloud environments, identity <em>is</em> the perimeter.
    If an attacker can abuse permissions, they don’t need malware,
    exploits, or infrastructure bugs.
</p>

<p>
    This article breaks down how cloud privilege escalation actually
    happens in AWS and Azure, and why
    <strong>identity misconfigurations are the fastest path to admin</strong>.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>The Shift: From Network Attacks to Identity Attacks</h2>

<p>
    Traditional security focused on:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Firewalls</li>
    <li>Network segmentation</li>
    <li>Exposed services</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Cloud-native environments flipped the model.
</p>

<p>
    Today, access is controlled by:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>IAM roles</li>
    <li>Policies</li>
    <li>Service permissions</li>
    <li>Trust relationships</li>
</ul>

<p>
    If identity is misconfigured, everything behind it is exposed,
    even if the network is “secure.”
</p>

<hr />

<h2>What Is Cloud Privilege Escalation?</h2>

<p>
    Cloud privilege escalation occurs when a user or role:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Starts with limited permissions</li>
    <li>Finds unintended access paths</li>
    <li>Chains permissions together</li>
    <li>Ends with elevated privileges</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The key insight:
</p>

<p>
    <strong>No single permission looks dangerous on its own.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    The danger appears when permissions are combined.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Common Entry Point: “Read-Only” Access</h2>

<p>
    Many cloud incidents begin with what looks harmless:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>A read-only IAM user</li>
    <li>A compromised CI/CD token</li>
    <li>An exposed cloud credential</li>
    <li>A leaked access key in a repo</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Teams often assume:
</p>

<p>
    <em>“It’s only read access, there’s nothing they can do.”</em>
</p>

<p>
    That assumption is wrong.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Why Read Permissions Are Dangerous</h2>

<p>
    Read access enables reconnaissance.
</p>

<p>
    With enough visibility, an attacker can:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Map IAM roles and policies</li>
    <li>Identify overly permissive roles</li>
    <li>Discover trust relationships</li>
    <li>Find services that can assume other roles</li>
</ul>

<p>
    This is where cloud attacks differ from traditional pentesting.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>The attack surface is logical, not technical.</strong>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Methodology: Mapping IAM Like an Attacker</h2>

<p>
    A real-world cloud privilege escalation workflow follows
    a predictable pattern.
</p>

<h3>Step 1: Enumerate Identity Permissions</h3>

<p>
    The goal is to answer:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Who am I?</li>
    <li>What can I see?</li>
    <li>What services can I interact with?</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Even limited permissions often allow attackers to
    <strong>list roles, policies, and attached permissions</strong>.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Step 2: Identify Privilege Escalation Paths</h3>

<p>
    Attackers look for permissions that enable:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Role assumption</li>
    <li>Policy modification</li>
    <li>Credential creation</li>
    <li>Service impersonation</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Individually, these permissions may seem acceptable.
</p>

<p>
    Combined, they become an escalation chain.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Step 3: Abuse Trust Relationships</h3>

<p>
    Cloud environments rely heavily on trust:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Services trusting roles</li>
    <li>Roles trusting other roles</li>
    <li>Cross-account access</li>
</ul>

<p>
    If a role trusts something it shouldn’t,
    attackers can pivot without exploiting a single vulnerability.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Scenario: From Read-Only to Administrator</h2>

<p>
    A common escalation path looks like this:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Start with read-only IAM access</li>
    <li>Discover a role with broader permissions</li>
    <li>Identify a service allowed to assume that role</li>
    <li>Trigger the service in an unintended way</li>
    <li>Gain access under a more powerful identity</li>
</ul>

<p>
    No exploits.
    No malware.
    Just permissions behaving exactly as configured.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Tooling: Pacu (AWS Exploitation Framework)</h2>

<p>
    Manually mapping cloud permissions is slow and error-prone.
</p>

<p>
    This is where tools like <strong>Pacu</strong> come in.
</p>

<p>
    Pacu helps security teams and attackers alike by:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Enumerating IAM permissions</li>
    <li>Identifying known escalation paths</li>
    <li>Mapping role trust relationships</li>
    <li>Highlighting risky configurations</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The real value of Pacu is not automation,
    it’s <strong>visibility</strong>.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Why These Attacks Are Hard to Detect</h2>

<p>
    Identity-based attacks often:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Use legitimate APIs</li>
    <li>Appear as normal cloud activity</li>
    <li>Generate no obvious alerts</li>
    <li>Blend into daily operations</li>
</ul>

<p>
    From a logging perspective, nothing looks “exploited.”
</p>

<p>
    Everything is technically working as designed.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>What Blue Teams Get Wrong</h2>

<p>
    Common defensive mistakes include:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Overly broad IAM roles</li>
    <li>Unused permissions left in place</li>
    <li>Unreviewed trust relationships</li>
    <li>No continuous IAM auditing</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Security teams often focus on:
</p>

<p>
    <em>“Who can access what?”</em>
</p>

<p>
    But attackers focus on:
</p>

<p>
    <strong>“Who can become who?”</strong>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Defensive Takeaways</h2>

<p>
    To reduce identity-based privilege escalation:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Apply least privilege aggressively</li>
    <li>Audit IAM roles continuously</li>
    <li>Review trust relationships regularly</li>
    <li>Monitor role assumption events</li>
    <li>Remove unused permissions</li>
</ul>

<p>
    In the cloud, identity sprawl is attack surface.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>
    Cloud security in 2025 is not about patching servers.
</p>

<p>
    It’s about controlling identity.
</p>

<p>
    If attackers can see your permissions,
    they can often see their path to admin.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>No zero-day required.</strong><br />
    <strong>Just one misconfigured role.</strong>
</p>
